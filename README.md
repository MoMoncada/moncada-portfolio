# Advanced CSS: Professional Portfolio


## Description

------------------

For this project I created a professional portfolio in which I will keep working during the duration of the course, this will later become my personal work portfolio.

The HTML and CSS code were written from scratch, designed using the advanced CSS techniques we've learned in class so far. While designing the structure of the document, it was importand to keep the criteria in mind.

- The document is divided into 3 main sections: "About Me", "Projects" and "Contact me".

- Project samples have been added, making the very first app slightly larger in size.

- All links have been tested and they take the user to the deployed applications, once the user has clicked on them.

- The UI scrolls to each section without issues.

- The page is responsive and adapts to different viewports.
